    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <h2>CSII ISP: Space Attack</h2>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Game Concept:</h3>
    <p>
      I wanted to make an infinite roguelike videogame where the player slowly
      builds up their arsenal and takes on increasingly more difficult enemies.
      To achieve this, the player controls a ship in space that is attacked by
      multiple enemy ships, and as the player defeats them they can place one of
      3 attachment types: two types of connector pieces, one a long rectangle,
      and another circle with 3 connector points. Lastly there is a placeable
      turret which shoots with the player.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>
      I've always enjoyed game mechanics where the player slowly upgrades
      themselves in a way where its immediately noticeable both visually and in
      gameplay which I believe to be the core of this project.
    </p>

    <h3>Code Segments:</h3>

    />
    <p>
      This function works by first making sure that the object isn't already
      placed so you can't place an object in the same place 2x. This works
      because this script runs individually on every game piece it is attached
      to. After this it moves the connection point, which is the small white
      circle, to the center of wherever the placed object will be and creates
      the attachment in that location. Making the attachment a child in the
      hierarchy allows all of the pieces to move with the player.
    </p>

    />
    <!-- put pic of code and hitbox detection demo -->
    <p>
      The game will not allow you to place an attachment where another one
      exists, destroying the part you attempted to place. One of the issues I
      had when implementing this was that the connection point, which always
      moved to where the attachment was going to be placed, would stay there.
      This moves it back into its original position and also refunds the points
      spent on it, allowing the player to place it elsewhere.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Overall I was very happy with how this project turned out, due to the game
      capturing that feeling of player progression and endless player choice. I
      learned a lot from this project due to this being the first time I had
      ever used Unity or C#, and came out with a solid understanding of what
      Unity is capable of and the process of game design. I had some ideas I
      wished to implement but ran out of time for such as adding a second, mini
      boss, type enemy ship that would slowly spawn more frequently the longer
      you stayed alive to give the game both a difficulty curve and the player a
      greater feeling of progression as they're forced to wipe out hordes of
      enemies that were very difficult to combat earlier into the run.
